There appears to be an error in the newman test that causes all REST calls to 
return 503.  Specifically, there is a double forward slash // in the URL.  
Since that endpoint does not exist, a 503 Service Unavailable is returned.

My unit tests (npm test) run to completion sucessfully and indicate correct
behavior.

Here are the results of the newman test, in which the // error is evident.
